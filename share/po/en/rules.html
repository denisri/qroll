<h2>Aim</h2>

<h3>Simple...</h3>

<p>Simple: get diamonds and exit by the door... The number of needed diams is specified in the right panel. The door(s) open(s) when the required number of diams have been taken.
</p>

<p>Time is limited, you have to complete the level within the required time.</p>

<h3>Sometimes, there are no diams, or not enough...</h3>

<p>In this case, you have to make some... Many elements in the game are to be explored, experimented, and maybe will help you to build jewels. Some of these elements may include monsters, special walls... But you will have to discover many others.</p>

<h3>I've got the required diams, but... where is the door ?</h3>

<p>Some facecious levels do not even have a door... This means that you will probably have to find or build one... Be creative...
</p>


<h3>Bonus life</h3>

<p>A "Bonus life" was originally (in the BoulderDash game) a small level which enabled to gain an extra life if it was completed. If failed, the next level was reached anyway, but with no additional life.
</p>

<p>In Rock'n'Roll, there is a "bonus life object", a special diam, which gives you a new life when eat. They are generally found in special levels, small ones like in the original game. You will sometimes have some work to find and take them. If you cannot reach them, taking the regular diam(s) and exiting is still allowed.
