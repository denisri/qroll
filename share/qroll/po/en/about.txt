/h/bROCK ' n ' ROLL






Yes ! The real, genuine

/bRock ' n ' Roll

The really real one, I've ported it to Unix at last
more than ten years after it was (almost) born
on Atari ST (hhh!, nostalgic sigh)





/iRock'n'Roll was designed and made by :




/bFirst idea, instigators

/i(in short, those who pushed me a bit
/iat the beginning to make me start
/iprogramming it) :




Fred�ic Relaix
Antoine Germain





/bProgramming

/i(Atari, PC, Unix) :




Denis Rivi�e





/bArtistic design :




Fred Relaix





/bGraphics artwork :




Fred Relaix

Denis Rivi�e (a little bit)
Antoine Germain (a tiny bit too)





/bNew ideas,

/inew concepts and elements :




Fred Relaix
Antoine Germain, a bit too





/bLevels :




Fred Relaix, mainly
(all the most sadistic ones !)


/ia little bit too (but with less involvement):

Antoine Germain
Denis Rivi�e
Christophe Relaix





/bSpreading, advertisement campaign :




Fred Relaix, for Atari version

...





/bContact :




For bug reports, suggestions, donations
(francs, euros, petrodollars wellcome),
send all them to :



/u/fnudz@free.fr




Only 1 contact, I've done the whole programming
myself anyway, and I'm the only and last
human being still to pay a little attention
to this game, the others don't really care
about it anymore, or at least won't give
any support for it







/iDid you notice ?



For the authors, with 3 names we can fill
a lot of boxes, and many jobs, then the
whole thing looks "pro", it looks like
dozens of people have worked full-time on
the program, it seems more serious...
