TODO :

* Levels editor
  - minor improvements in levels editor, like stipple drawing, undo 
    modifications...

* Finish the network interface:
  - allow transmission of the whole level to play
  - allow incoming connections / new players during game
  - still some bugs I think...

* Finish the missing game elements

* Make some game parameters more flexible: for instance allow explosions or 
  blob transformation patterns of variable size (it's always 3x3 now).

* Rework graphics
  - modify old Atari's images to the higher resolution used now, use more 
    colors
  - add intermediate animations

* Rework sounds

* Finish porting to windows:
  - sound
  - fix little timing problem (maybe due to Qt ?)


BUGS :

* Bombs delaying doesn't work exactly like in the original Atari ST version, 
  so many "bonus life" levels with precise timing tweakings don't work anymore

* (Windows only): the new raw format has some problems...

* (Windows only): timing is not precise at all, so the game is slow (under w98 
  at least). I think it's a problem with timers in windows9x used by Qt
