	Installation of Rock'N'Roll
	---------------------------



** What is necessary to compile and use this marvelous game: **

- UNIX system (tested under Linux ans Solaris)
  or Windows 9x/NT/XP
  or Mac OS 10.x

- C++ compiler (tested with GNU gcc, versions 2.95 to 4.1)

- Qt graphics librairy (http://www.trolltech.com) v3.x

- Python language (2.2 or newer sould be OK): the compilation tools provided
  to generate Makefiles are written in Python. Without it you'll have to
  write the Makefiles by hand...



1) Uncompress the tar file:
   ------------------------

- with GNU tar:

tar xfz qroll-0.5.tar.gz

- with another tar programm without the -z option (Sun tar...):

gunzip qroll-0.5.tar.gz
tar xf qroll-0.5.tar


2) configure / compile the sources:
   --------------------------------

./qroll-0.7/build-config --buildMode release --version 0.7 qroll

* The compilation generates a build tree outside the source tree: here,
  qroll-0.7-linux-release for instance. In this build tree,
* The library is installed in the lib/ directory.
  It is named libqroll.so.0.7 (unix/elf), or libqroll.dylib.0.7 (Mac), or
  libqroll.dll.0.7 (windows)
* The executable program is in bin/


3) Allow access to the dynamic library:
   ------------------------------------

- either by copying it into a place refered by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, 
  or by putting there a suitable link
  * On Mac, the environment variable governing dynamic libraries loading is
    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  * On Windows, it is PATH (same as for executable programs)

- either by adding the libs directory /.../qroll-x.x-linux-release/lib in your
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:

  * csh, tcsh shells:
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\:/...whatever.../qroll-0.7-linux-release/lib

  * sh, bash shells:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/...whatever.../qroll-0.7-linux-release/lib


4) Put the executable in the PATH:
   -------------------------------

- either by copying it into a place in the PATH, or by putting there a 
  suitable link

- or by adding the R&R executable directory to your PATH variable:

  * csh, tcsh shells:
setenv PATH $PATH\:/...whatever.../qroll-0.7-linux-release/bin

  * sh, bash shells:
export PATH=$PATH:/...whatever.../qroll-0.7-linux-release/bin


5) On csh/tcsh shells only: type: rehash (to rescan the PATH)
   ----------------------------------------------------------


6) Define the ROLLDIR variable with the path to R&R data:
   ------------------------------------------------------

  * csh, tcsh shells:
setenv ROLLDIR /...whatever.../qroll-0.7/share/qroll

  * sh, bash shells:
export ROLLDIR=/...whatever.../qroll-0.7/share/qroll


8) That's it...
   ------------

qroll can be executed (by typing qroll)
