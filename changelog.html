<h4>
02/09/07 - version 0.7-non-final</h4>
Version 0.7 is <b>NOT finished</b>, it's just a pre-release
<ul>
<li>
<b>Porting to MacOS X:</b> QRoll now runs on Mac too...</li>
<li>Porting to Irix (SGI), without sound.</li>
<li>Compatibility improvements: QRoll now also works on Windows with MinGW 
compiler. In the future I will probably use this solution to make the binary 
packages because it is simpler for me, even if executables are much bigger,
I don't care, it's your problem when downloading ;-)</li>
<li>Porting to Qt 4. QRoll bulds either wuth Qt 3 or 4.</li>
<li>Sound:
  <ul>
  <li>all sounds now use the standard .wav format</li>
  <li>on platforms where the Qt sound system works, it can be used to make the 
  game sounds. I have tested it on Windows and Mac.
  However my own sound server is far better on Linux/Solaris (it allows sound
  mixing and priority handling, which QSound does not apparently)
  </li>
  <li>So, Linux and Solaris continue to use my sound system</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>I now use a more recent build system, still developped in my work,
which configures/builds everything automatically
</li>
<li>QRoll can save a config file to remember some settings (like openGL options)
</li>
</ul>


<h4>24/01/02 - version 0.6</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Series formats:</b> re-wrote storage stuff (IO routines, series storage
classes, etc.). I have created a new file format different from the old
Atari inherited one, and which does not suffer its limitations. I hope
both formats will be supported, QRoll can read both formats but only write
the newer right now. This new IO routines will also be useful for transmitting
level maps in networked games.</li>

<br>You can also merge several series by appending one to the currently
loaded one.
<br>The new format is less compact than the older one, files are about
twice as big as they used to be, since elements are now coded in 16 bits
rather than "paletted 8 bits", and all parameters are ASCII tags. But we
don't have the same memory/disk savings constraints as we had 15 years
ago, do we ? (alternately we could compress them)
<br><b><i><font color="#990000">Be careful</font></i></b>: the new "raw"
format has changed between QRoll-0.6alpha/beta and the final 0.6 version:
sizes have been added in the redefined explosions and blobs, so it's <i>NOT</i>
compatible. Such incompatible changes won't happen anymore in the future
(changes in the format will cause a new format version). I think nobody
wrote levels with the non-final version, but if it happens to be, write me
(<a href="mailto:nudz@free.fr">nudz@free.fr</a>) and I'll make a converter.
<li>
<b>Network:</b> synchronization on server side to wait for slow clients
- still lots of things to be done to have all network things working.</li>

<li>
<b>Edition:</b> a bunch of new functionalities and new windows... you can
now:</li>

<br>- edit existing levels, draw in them using elements from an "<b><i>element
palette</i></b>" window. This window look is maybe not the best of computer
graphics interface science: to be improved...
<br>- framework for multiple drawing modes (paint, fill, airbrush etc)
is implemented and you can already paint, fill or draw rectangles, copy
regions, paste &amp; pattern draw. Supplementary drawing operations like
airbrush may be done in the "near future"...
<br>- play modified maps
<br>- save levels to disk
<br>- edit levels parameters such as number of needed diams, time etc.
using a "<b><i>levels parameters</i></b>" window which can also prove useful
to quickly change to another level.
<br>- resize levels
<br>- edit colors
<br>- edit explosions and blobs redefinitions: modify, add, delete them.
<br>- add / delete levels
<br>- new "<b><i>Series arranger</i></b>" window: allows to move, copy/cut/paste/drag&amp;drop
levels and reorder a whole series. <i>The</i> tool which was crually missing
on the original Atari ST version and which will be necessary to make a
little cleanup in the mess of our level series. You can also use drag&amp;drop
or copy/paste for cross-application copying (between two QRoll processes).
Hint: double-clicking on a level instantly makes it the current level of
the main window.
<br>You can <b><i>STILL NOT</i></b>:
<br>- undo drawings or modifications
<br>- draw, copy or paste background elements (things behind a portcullis
or in a container wall)
<br>Now ALL levels and series data and parameters can be edited, even if
some operations could be made more easy.
<li>
Tested and modified Qroll to <b>work with Qt 3</b> or Qt 2, but there are
still minor layout issues with Qt-3 (but I think it's a bug in Qt!)</li>

<li>
Little fixes in some game elements behaviour or animation, mainly in elements
unused in existing levels. A little bit of cleaning has been done in the
game elements object structure (not finished, many parameters still rely
on a bit flags file loaded from the old Atari version).</li>

<li>
Minor tiny things (don't force font sizes anymore, this Changelog has moved
to HTML version, small fixes in the about window, changed the about window
music for a more "rock'n'roll" one (but sorry I'm still not a musician),
little fixes in drawing limits on game windows, ...)</li>
</ul>
<b>Known bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Under windows,</i></b> the new "raw" disk format has some problems
I don't understand yet. It's apparently due to a different handling of
end of lines in ASCII mode and switching between ASCII and binary reading
in the same file. As a result, files are not read correctly but fail at
some point in the file (sometimes after 30 levels have been successfully
read). Quite mysterious...</li>
</ul>

<h4>
27/07/01 - version 0.5</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Porting to Windows:</b> as TrollTech released a freeware version of
Qt/Windows it became possible to compile most of the code under Windows.
Sound is disabled in this version, but the remaining compiles OK, including
OpenGL stuff and networking things. Tested with Microsoft VC++ and Intel
C++.</li>

<li>
<b>Network</b> interface entirely remade from scratch. Everything doesn't
work yet - you can't join an already running game, but the main things
do work: start R&amp;R, connect every player, then start game from the
server - it should work OK (I hope).</li>

<li>
Sources: <b>reorganization of the source tree</b>, now uses <a href="http://papadopo.free.fr/">Dimitri
Papadopoulos</a> 's "<b><i>maker</i></b>" to build Makefiles (it is similar
to Trolltech's tmake). It's easier to compile now...</li>

<li>
<b>Internationalization:</b> Version 0.3 was french-only, 0.5 supports
Qt's translation system, so it's now french and english, and can be translated
to any other language. (uh, I'm not really sure it will be useful in fact...)</li>

<li>
<b>Alternative graphics routines:</b> Rock'n'Roll can now use <b>OpenGL</b>
to draw the game, it can be much faster (hardware scaling...) but it doesn't
work well in all cases. Two alternative rendering methods can be used,
one which uses lots of textures and some are not drawn, one using only
2D functions but isn't accelerated with all graphics drivers (or cards).</li>

<li>
<b>Bugfixes</b> in some of the elements behaviours</li>

<li>
<b>Config window:</b> you can choose there some options (game, graphics,
levels debugging options, ...)</li>

<li>
<b>Mouse actions:</b> you can now scroll levels with the mouse (right button)
like in Atari ST version...</li>

<li>
<b>Levels editor embryo</b>, but the edit mode is <b><i>useless</i></b>
right now: edited levels are highly volatile: you can only paint and lose
your drawings, they are never saved and disapear as soon as you change
level or start the game... Anyway, it's promising, isn't it ?</li>
</ul>

<h4>
version 0.4</h4>

<blockquote>This version was a transition, it never really existed. But
it is just to say that I started working on R&amp;R again (after a pause
of about 1 1/2 years...)</blockquote>

<h4>
version 0.3, jan or feb. 1999</h4>

<blockquote>Base verison, the game is working.</blockquote>
